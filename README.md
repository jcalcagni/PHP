This repo contains several samples/directories of some HP code I used to learn some of the basics of PHP programming.

"includes" is there I place any headers, footers, functions, etc
"data-admin" is a small app (using a MySQL database) that I created to track software releases by Business Analyst,
 Business Division and the item or "Ticket". This app was designed to replace spreadsheets used to track this information
